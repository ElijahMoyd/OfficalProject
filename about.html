        Elijah Moyd is 17 year old young man who was born in February 8, 2001 at Brooklyn,NY. His family consists of 2 brothers (He didn't get to meet one of them as well of the sister he knew about later on in life), mother and a father. They weren't the best normal type of family since they were all dysfunctional but what family is ever perfect. In his years of growing up he begin to explore new things, new ideas, and new beginning of his coming days of enlightment. In his early days of childhood, he loved playing video games which 1  begin to become one of his lifestyle as well as other interests he picked up while growing up. He wondered how these things he enjoy come to be and he did because of one poster he spotted at a science class in middle school. The poster listed out professions that involved science or contributed it and one of those professions caught his eye...."Game designing." This is what he wanted to be, someone that make something he loved. But in his early days of high school, his mind expanded to new things such as technology (He was a master at technology at the age of 8) and the love of drawing. He loved art and the storytelling behind it where you can see it in books, comics, movies, tv, drawings or basically anywhere. He practiced for a good while until he was frustrated and gave up on trying until he had the feeling to do so again. But technology was his talent. Anything involving technology, he could help everyone with (He even became the assistant on OBT even though he supposed to be learning...RIGHT MR.ORTEGA.) But even though he was a prodgy at his profession, he still wanted to master the art of drawing and storytelling. He loved when stories drive an individual to serious of emotions even though it may be fiction or real because his words, "Great reactions bring out the joy of someone."Elijah's personal life was a whole adventure itself. He had alot of brick walls in his life, being bullied at elementary so bad that he had to change schools to being robbed at a train station near his high school,and many other unfortunate events. Despite all these unfortunate events, it didn't faze who he is or change him because he know how the world is. But he used these events that either hurt him or benefit him as experience and a lesson on what's to come in the foreseeabnle future. But not all things was bad for him, he had loyal friends, loving family during his years and mentors that continued to further his knowledge so he can reach his full potential. He had a strong academic background with his grades which rewarded him wtih academic awards with both in his middle and high school. His prodigious legacy of a life continues on as he makes this presentation for his fellow workers/friends to make sure he is the perfect fit for not only as a web developer...but as an assistant.
